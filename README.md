Follow the steps below to set up and run the application.

1. Start the Frontend

Run the following commands in your terminal:

cd {root_dir}/frontend/
npm install   # Install dependencies
npm run start # Start the frontend development server
```

2. Start the Backend

In a new terminal window, navigate to the backend directory and start the server:
